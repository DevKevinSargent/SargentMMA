Hey there,

I want to make this a bit informal. My name is Kevin. I'm a CompTIA certified professional, a former tech support lead, and former hybrid fiberoptic/coaxial cable technichian. For several years I've been living overseas, teaching English, and missing technology. I started learning programming as a way to reconnect with technology and persue a career I'm passionate about. I've studied in order: coding basics, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, Ruby, GDScript, and Python. I'm mostly interested in working in Java or Python but willing to learn new languages. I learn fairly quick. Anyways I've been working on a video game as a way to showcase my skills and I hope you will play the game and reach out to me if you think I can help your business. I really want to make this career change and I'm eager to learn and grow as a programmer.
