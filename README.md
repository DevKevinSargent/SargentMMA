Hey there,

I want to make this a bit informal. My name is Kevin. I'm a CompTIA certified professional, a former tech support lead, and former hybrid fiberoptic/coaxial cable technichian. For several years I've been living overseas, teaching English, and missing technology. I started learning programming as a way to reconnect with technology and persue a career I'm passionate about. I've studied in order: coding basics, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, Ruby, GDScript, and Python. I'm mostly interested in working in Java or Python but willing to learn new languages. I learn fairly quick. Anyways I've been working on a video game as a way to showcase my skills and I hope you will play the game and reach out to me if you think I can help your business. I really want to make this career change and I'm eager to learn and grow as a programmer.

Also feel free to send me any inquiries. I'm very eager to get working. 

Thank you,

edit: I noticed Windows doesn't trust my game program but I can certify as the only contributor that it's 100% safe and no installation is necessary. Feel free tio scan it with anti-virus software prior to launch. It's just a ton of scripts, artwork, and a few music tracks. The scripts are 100% done by myself. The artwork is 99% done by me. The music (only a few songs) however is aquired from people who are far more musically giften than myself.
